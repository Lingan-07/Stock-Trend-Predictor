# Stock-Trend-Predictor

Project Name: Stock Trend Predictor: Logistic Regression Model

Description: This project implements a machine learning model using logistic regression to predict stock market trends. The model analyzes historical stock data to forecast whether a stock's price will rise or fall. The predictions are based on various technical indicators, such as percentage change in high and close prices, volume, and other derived metrics.

Features:

Predicts the stock market movement (up or down) based on historical data.

Calculates technical indicators like High_Low Percentage and Percentage Change for feature engineering.

Uses logistic regression for binary classification of stock price movement.

Makes predictions for future stock trends (e.g., next 7 days).

Scalable to different stock datasets by modifying the input CSV file.
